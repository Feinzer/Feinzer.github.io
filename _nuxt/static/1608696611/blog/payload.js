For example a simple card you would think it's just a div with a background, margin, padding, rounded corners and a shadow but BootstrapVue says NO, that thing was like 5 divs inside each other for NO REASON and trying to make a class for it would only affect the innermost layer, making a simple task like applying a margin take half an hour.
